\section{\texttt{tNETacle}, What is it?}
The tNETacle proposes an easy, efficient and intuitive way to establish
decentralized (peer-to-peer) Virtual Private Networks. It will provide all the
VPN\footnote{Inter-network connection that links two different local networks
securely.} technologies, ensuring via strong encryption and authentication to
control transactions integrity between different machines.\\

The tNETacle aims to facilitate the establishment of this kind of network so
that unskilled users can enjoy the benefits of these technologies without efforts and
prior formation.\\

It also aims to provide to more experienced users an easy way to
deploy more complex networks ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the
data transiting over the network.\\

There will be two axes that drive the project developement:
\begin{itemize}
\item The tnetacle-core, the project's intelligence, will be responsible of the
network management and will provide a pseudo-interface usable as any other
network system interface.
\item The tnetacle-client will offer to neophytes the ability very simply and
intuitively to access to the core features. This part wont be required for the
proper functioning of the networks created via the tnetacle-core, and wont do
anything but providing an additional abstraction to the features.
\end{itemize}
