tNETacle.dat
============

Introduction
------------

This file will help you to use the tNETacle fortune database.
It's a collection of quotes from IRC/SILC channels or hackathon where tNETacle
devs have been.

Beware, some quotes are in French, and nearly all of them are private jokes.

Fortunes files are splited in two:

  * A text file containing the quotes;
  * A binary file, the 'random access data' file;

We ship a pre-compiled tNETacle.dat file which should be sufficient for a simple
installation.

If you plan to add a new quotes, then read the next section, but if you just
want to install the files, go to *Installation*.

Compilation
-----------

First you need a fortune compiler, like strfile:

  * FreeBSD: Shipped by default;
  * OpenBSD, NetBSD: Source code here: `/usr/src/games/fortune/strfile/`;
  * Solaris: OpenCSW package `fortune`;
  * Debian, Ubuntu: Package `fortune-mod`;
  * Others: http://github.com/Aversiste/strfile;

When you finally found and installed/compiled it, you can run this command:

    $ strfile dat/tNETacle
    "tNETacle.dat" created
    There were 8 strings
    Longest string: 309 bytes
    Shortest string: 37 bytes

Installation
------------

You can now install these two files in your fortune directory, probably
`/usr/share/games/fortune`.

You can now test the success of the operation and be delighted with a quote.

    $ fortune -f
    ___% /usr/share/games/fortune
	...
	___% tNETacle
    $ fortune tNETacle
    Normalement l√† je perd ma bite.
                    -- @tribouille
