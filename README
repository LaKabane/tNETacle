Requirements
------------

Add the tNETacle default user (_tnetacle) with '/var/empty' as home,
owned by root with permission 700, or the tNETacle will refuse to start.

Install OpenSSL, Libevent-2.0.x (both _core and _openssl), Yajl 2.x and zlib.
If you are under Linux you might install libbsd too, but it's not mandatory.

Depending of your system you should now install either tapcfg or libtuntap.
libtuntap is prefered but not available on FreeBSD, Windows and Mac OS X.

Install CMake, then run something like
    mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
If something is wrong at this stage, drop us an email.

Now you can edit dat/tNETacle.conf for your need and copy it to
/etc/tNETacle.conf. If this directory is not the one you want, change it in
/include/pathnames.h.
